**Why I chose cypress with cucumber** 

Cypress is a tool that allows you to write both front-end and back-end tests, it was developed for the modern web. Widely used by developers and quality assurance engineers who build web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.
Cypress is a free, open source, locally installed framework and also offers you a Dashboard to track your tests and provides integration with Cucumber for writing the test scenarios in BDD format.
